/* The suite must never point at a remote database — see SETUP.md §3.
 *
 * This is the cheapest possible guard for the two rules that are easy to
 * break silently and expensive to diagnose:
 *
 *   1. Remote drift. If .env.test picks up a cloud URL, or the
 *      `dotenv -e .env.test -e .env.local` ordering breaks so .env.local
 *      wins, the suite still passes — just 150x slower, with timeouts that
 *      look exactly like flaky tests. Hours have gone into chasing that.
 *   2. Cross-project bleed. These builds carry different data sensitivities
 *      and must not share a database. Pointing at a sibling's test DB would
 *      otherwise go unnoticed until something leaked.
 *
 * If this file is the only thing failing, fix the environment, not the test.
